# postgis_upgrade
docker to upgrade postgresql with postgis installed

# thanks
This image is inspired by the work of the following images:
* upgrade postgres: https://github.com/tianon/docker-postgres-upgrade
* postgres + postgis: https://github.com/appropriate/docker-postgis

# notice
we add an extra `localedef` in the image currently, probably we will think a different way to configure it
